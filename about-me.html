          <h2>Why I'm pursuing this Certificate</h2>
          <p> I've used various dashboarding and reporting software ranging from: Crystal Reports, SSRS, IBM Cognos, Tableau, and R Shiny. All these software have their pros and cons but mostly have limitations that necessitates workarounds or looking for alternative solutions. The most recent tool I used was R Shiny, which was great because I already use R for data modelling. R shiny essentially converts R scripts to javascript, HTML, and CSS in the background. Instead of using R to generate these background scripts, I'm interested in learning how to design web applications without the need to go through R Shiny. My customers are starting to demand their analysis be delivered on multiple platforms including mobile. I'm hoping the skills that I learn through the certificate program will enable me to deliver better products to my customer.</p>
